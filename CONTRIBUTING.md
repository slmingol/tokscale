# Contributing to Tokscale

Thanks for your interest in improving Tokscale. This guide covers the development workflow and the most common contribution — adding support for a new AI coding client. For commit-message and pull-request conventions, see [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## Development setup

Tokscale is a Cargo workspace (the `tokscale` CLI and its core library) plus a Next.js web frontend.

Prerequisites: a stable Rust toolchain (`rustup` recommended) and [Bun](https://bun.sh) for the frontend and package scripts. Alternatively, Docker or Podman (with `docker compose` / `podman compose`) can substitute for both — the repo ships a `Makefile` that builds and runs everything in containers.

| Task | `make` target | Raw command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format check | `make fmt/rs/check` | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| Lint (must pass with **no** warnings) | `make lint/rs` | `cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings` |
| Rust tests | `make test/rs` | `cargo test --workspace --all-features` |
| Build the CLI | `make build/cli` | `cargo build --release -p tokscale-cli` |
| Frontend dev server | `make dev/frontend` | `bun run dev:frontend` |
| Frontend registry contract | `make test/frontend` | `bun run --cwd packages/frontend test` |
| Frontend type check | `make typecheck` | `bun run --cwd packages/frontend typecheck` |
| Start full stack (DB + web) | `make up` | `docker/podman compose up --build -d` |
| Launch TUI in a container | `make tui` | `docker/podman compose --profile tui run --rm tui` |

Run `make help` for the full target list.

CI runs format, Clippy, and Rust tests on Linux, then builds the supported release targets separately. Frontend CI runs Vitest, migration replay, and the type check; it also runs when `crates/tokscale-core/src/clients.rs` or a GitHub CDN asset changes, so cross-registry client checks cannot be skipped by a Rust-only integration PR. A clean local `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` is the baseline for a reviewable PR.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/tokscale-core` | Client registry, per-client session parsers, scanner, aggregation, and cache |
| `crates/tokscale-cli` | CLI entrypoint, argument parsing, and the terminal UI |
| `packages/frontend` | Next.js web app: public profiles, the submission API, and the frontend client registry |
| `.github/assets` | Client logos, served to the frontend over the GitHub raw CDN |

## Adding a new client integration

A "client" is one AI coding tool whose local session logs Tokscale scans, parses, and reports (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and so on). A complete integration spans three areas — the Rust core, the CLI, and the web frontend — and the frontend half is required even though the Rust build passes without it. The single most common mistake is registering a client only in Rust: the CLI then scans and submits usage for it, but the server rejects every submission that includes it. See [Registry enforcement](#registry-enforcement) for why.

Work through the checklist in order.

### 1. Register the client (Rust core)

Add an entry to the `define_clients!` invocation in `crates/tokscale-core/src/clients.rs`. Indices must be sequential — use the next unused number (a compile-time assertion enforces this):

```rust
Pi = 8 => {
    id: "pi",                       // stable id used everywhere: CLI flag, submit payload, frontend
    root: PathRoot::Home,           // base directory the relative path resolves against
    relative: ".pi/agent/sessions", // where the client stores its session logs
    pattern: "*.jsonl",             // glob for session files under that directory
    headless: false,                // supports headless / subprocess capture
    parse_local: true,              // parse files locally (vs. remote-only)
    submit_default: true            // included in `tokscale submit` by default
},
```

The `id` string is the contract that ties every other layer together. Choose it once and reuse it verbatim.

### 2. Write the parser (Rust core)

Add `crates/tokscale-core/src/sessions/<client>.rs` with a function that returns `Vec<UnifiedMessage>`, and register the module in `crates/tokscale-core/src/sessions/mod.rs` with `pub mod <client>;`. Model it on an existing parser of the same shape — JSONL (`pi.rs`), SQLite (`opencode.rs`), or NDJSON (`devin.rs`). Parse defensively: skip malformed rows instead of panicking, and clamp token counts to non-negative values.

### 3. Wire discovery and dispatch (Rust core)

Discover the client's session files in `crates/tokscale-core/src/scanner.rs` (follow the pattern used by a similar client), then dispatch parsing inside `parse_all_messages_*` in `crates/tokscale-core/src/lib.rs`, passing the client identity so cache entries record their owner:

```rust
load_or_parse_source(
    message_cache::CacheIdentity::for_client(ClientId::MyClient),
    path,
    &source_cache,
    pricing,
    sessions::myclient::parse_myclient_file,
);
```

Neither step is compile-enforced: a client that is registered but not wired here builds cleanly and silently produces no data.

### 4. Wire the CLI

In `crates/tokscale-cli/src/main.rs`, add the `ClientFilter` variant and its two mappings — the `id` string and the `ClientId` it resolves to — so `--client <id>` works. In `crates/tokscale-cli/src/tui/client_ui.rs`, add a `ClientUi { display_name, hotkey }` entry with an unused `hotkey`. `CLIENT_UI` is a fixed-size array (`[ClientUi; ClientId::COUNT]`), so the build fails until it has exactly one entry per client.

### 5. Register the client on the web frontend (required)

This is the step that is easy to miss and that breaks real usage. Add the `id` to the frontend registry:

- `packages/frontend/src/lib/types.ts` — add the `id` to `SUPPORTED_CLIENT_TYPES`. **This list gates `POST /api/submit`.** A submission that contains any client id not in this list is rejected in full, so a client missing here cannot submit at all.
- `packages/frontend/src/lib/constants.ts` — add the `id` to all three per-client registries: `SOURCE_DISPLAY_NAMES` (human-readable name), `SOURCE_LOGOS` (logo URL — see step 6), and `SOURCE_COLORS` (a chart color that reads well in both light and dark themes).

Because those three are `Record<ClientType, …>`, `tsc` fails to compile once the id is in `SUPPORTED_CLIENT_TYPES` until each has an entry — so if you start with `types.ts`, the type checker guides you through the rest.

The frontend registry contract test also reads the Rust `define_clients!` list, validates each id through the submit schema, and checks its display name, logo, and color. Frontend CI is explicitly triggered by `clients.rs`, so adding a Rust client without completing this step fails before merge.

### 6. Add the logo asset

Add `.github/assets/client-<id>.png` (or `.jpg`) and reference it from `SOURCE_LOGOS`:

```ts
"<id>": `${GITHUB_CDN_BASE}/client-<id>.png`,
```

`SOURCE_LOGOS` may point at an external URL instead, but any `GITHUB_CDN_BASE` reference must resolve to a file that exists in `.github/assets` on `main`, or the frontend renders a broken image. CLI and desktop variants of the same product may share a single asset (as `antigravity` and `antigravity-cli` do).

The frontend registry contract test checks every GitHub CDN logo against the checked-in asset directory. It is triggered by `.github/assets/**` changes as well as frontend changes.

### 7. Update user-facing documentation

Add the client to the supported-client overview and feature list in `README.md`, plus the data-location matrix when a platform-specific path matters. Mirror those user-facing updates in the maintained localized READMEs (`README.ko.md`, `README.ja.md`, and `README.zh-cn.md`).

### Registry enforcement

Some registries fail the build when they are incomplete; others fail silently at runtime. Know which is which:

| Registry / step | Enforced by | If omitted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `define_clients!` sequential index | Rust compile-time assertion | Build fails |
| `CLIENT_UI` array | Rust fixed-size array | Build fails |
| `SOURCE_DISPLAY_NAMES` / `SOURCE_LOGOS` / `SOURCE_COLORS` | TypeScript `Record<ClientType>` + frontend registry contract test | Type check or CI test fails |
| **`SUPPORTED_CLIENT_TYPES`** | **Frontend registry contract test, triggered by Rust registry changes** | **CI fails before a server-rejected client ships** |
| Scanner + `lib.rs` dispatch | Nothing | Client is defined but scans and reports no data |
| Logo asset file | Frontend registry contract test, triggered by asset changes | CI fails for a missing GitHub CDN asset |

The scanner/dispatch row is the remaining silent integration gap. Verify it by hand.

### Verifying the integration

1. Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace --all-features`.
2. Add a parser unit test with a small fixture in the client's real log format.
3. Run `tokscale --no-spinner --client <id>` against real local data and confirm the message and token counts look right.
4. Run `bun run --cwd packages/frontend test -- __tests__/lib/clientRegistry.test.ts` and `bun run --cwd packages/frontend typecheck`.
5. Update the supported-client and data-location documentation, including maintained translations.

## Commit messages and pull requests

Tokscale uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), and a PR title becomes its squash-merge commit message. The full rules — allowed types, atomic-commit guidance, and title restrictions — live in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md). In short: a new client is a `feat` (for example, `feat(clients): add <Name> session parsing`), and titles should describe the change, not internal review or process labels.
